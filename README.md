# w0rp's Scripts

This is a 'script' directory I use personally for fiddling with things.
The scripts aren't supposed to be perfect or even usable by people other
than me, but someone might find them interesting.

There is a 'bashrc' file in the directory I use for including just about
everything on whichever machine I'm on, and making my shells work in
roughly the same way.

Everything in here is public domain, unless stated otherwise.
